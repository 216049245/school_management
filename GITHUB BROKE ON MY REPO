Github cannot resolve simple changes. I am now 45 commits behind after being 30 commits behind. in less than an hour
I hate github and I'd like to see if lecturers can resolve this github issue. I dont think anyone beside the creator of github, can solve this.

Issues before problem:
 1) My work was working fine
 2) We (Brandon and I) were working on pushing my work to the repo to update my work and it broke at 8:45pm
 3) for 2 hours we have tried to fix this issue. I have a team member as witness. The issue given is silly and one file which is causing an issue, is not even my file? its Siphiwes.
 
 problems now: 
 - I am behind on commits. almost 45 or more.
 - Brandon and I tried to get my work back without issues and we got an older version back without my work 
 - Not sure how Git can run into such a heavy issue,
